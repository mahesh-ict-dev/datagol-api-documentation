description: Browse and try all DataGOL API endpoints.

The **API Reference** section is generated from the OpenAPI specification. Use the sidebar to jump to any endpoint.

Each endpoint page includes :

- **Parameters** — Path, query, and header parameters
- **Request body** — Schema and examples where applicable
- **Responses** — Status codes and response schemas
- **Try it** — Interactive playground when a server URL is configured

Endpoints are grouped by tag (e.g. workflow, identity, widgets). Start with the endpoint you need and refer to the shared schemas for request/response shapes.
