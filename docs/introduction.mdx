Welcome to the **DataGOL API** documentation.

This site documents the full API surface for workflows, connectors, widgets, identity, ETL, and more. Use the **API Reference** tab to browse and try endpoints.

## What you'll find here

- **Documentation** — Overview and getting started (this section).
- **API Reference** — Auto-generated reference from the OpenAPI spec, including request/response schemas and an interactive playground where supported.

## Base URL

API requests use the base URL configured in the OpenAPI specification (for example, `https://www.domain.com`). Override it in the API playground if your environment uses a different host.

## Next steps

Open the **API Reference** tab and pick an endpoint to view parameters, request bodies, and responses.
