title: AI Extraction & Knowledge Graph
description: Use AI Extraction and Knowledge Graph APIs to process content and build graph data.
---

DataGOL exposes **AI Extraction** and **Knowledge Graph** APIs so you can extract structured data from documents and manage knowledge graphs in your workspace.

**Where to find them:** Open the **API Reference** tab (top navigation). In the left sidebar you’ll see groups **AI Extraction** and **Knowledge Graph** — expand those to see and try each endpoint.

## AI Extraction APIs

Base path: `https://be.datagol.ai/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/...`

| Method | Endpoint | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/extraction/schema/generate` | Generate Schema for Advanced Extraction |
| POST | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/extraction/advanced/test` | Test API for Advanced Extraction |
| POST | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/extraction` | Create Extraction |
| PUT | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/extraction/{extraction_id}` | Update Extraction |
| DELETE | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/extraction/{extractionId}` | Delete Extraction |
| GET | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspace_id}/extraction/{element_type}/{element_id}` | Get Extractions |
| POST | `/noCo/api/v2/workspaces/{workspace_id}/extraction/{extraction_id}/{element_type}/{element_id}/run` | Trigger Extraction |
| GET | `/noCo/api/v1/requestLog/status/{request_id}` | Poll Status |

## Knowledge Graph APIs

Base path: `https://be.datagol.ai/ai/api/v2/knowledge-graph...`

| Method | Endpoint | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/ai/api/v2/knowledge-graph/create` | Create Knowledge Graph |
| GET | `/ai/api/v2/knowledge-graph/status` | Get Knowledge Graph Status |
| GET | `/ai/api/v2/knowledge-graph` | Get Knowledge Graph |

## AI Extraction (overview)

AI Extraction lets you define schemas and run extraction jobs on workspace content (files, folders): schema generation from prompts, advanced extraction with custom schemas, and create/update/delete extraction configs. Use **Trigger Extraction** to run and **Poll Status** to check progress.

## Knowledge Graph (overview)

Knowledge Graph APIs let you create and query knowledge graphs: **Create Knowledge Graph** to start a job, **Get Knowledge Graph Status** to check status, and **Get Knowledge Graph** to retrieve the graph.

## Authentication

All AI Extraction and Knowledge Graph endpoints use the **x-auth-token** header (workbook/workspace API). Include your workspace token in each request.

## Next steps

Go to the **API Reference** tab and expand **AI Extraction** or **Knowledge Graph** to see request parameters, bodies, and responses for each endpoint.
