title: AI Extraction & Knowledge Graph
description: Use AI Extraction and Knowledge Graph APIs to process content and build graph data.
---

DataGOL exposes **AI Extraction** and **Knowledge Graph** APIs so you can extract structured data from documents and manage knowledge graphs in your workspace.

## AI Extraction

AI Extraction lets you define schemas and run extraction jobs on workspace content (files, folders). Use it for:

- **Schema generation** — Generate extraction schemas from prompts.
- **Advanced extraction** — Test and run extractions with custom schemas.
- **Extraction configs** — Create, update, and manage extraction configurations (standard or advanced).
- **Runs** — Trigger extraction on elements and poll for status.

**In the API Reference:** Open the **API Reference** tab and use the **AI Extraction** group for endpoints such as:

- Generate Schema for Advanced Extraction  
- Test API for Advanced Extraction  
- Create / Update / Delete Extraction  
- Trigger Extraction Run  
- Poll Status  

## Knowledge Graph

Knowledge Graph APIs let you create and query knowledge graphs in a workspace.

- **Create Knowledge Graph** — Start a new knowledge graph job.
- **Get Knowledge Graph Status** — Check job status.
- **Get Knowledge Graph** — Retrieve the generated graph.

**In the API Reference:** Open the **API Reference** tab and use the **Knowledge Graph** group for these endpoints.

## Authentication

All AI Extraction and Knowledge Graph endpoints use the **x-auth-token** header (workbook/workspace API). Include your workspace token in each request.

## Next steps

Go to the **API Reference** tab and expand **AI Extraction** or **Knowledge Graph** to see request parameters, bodies, and responses for each endpoint.
